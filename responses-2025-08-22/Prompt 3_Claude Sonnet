Here are some examples of dialogue that might occur in BDSM scenes, focusing on communication and consent:

**Negotiation/Check-in dialogue:**
- "What are your limits today?"
- "How are you feeling right now?"
- "Is this intensity working for you?"
- "Do you need water or a break?"

**Consent and boundary dialogue:**
- "Yes, Sir/Ma'am"
- "Please may I..."
- "That's my limit"
- "I need to slow down"

**Safe word usage:**
- "Yellow" (slow down/check in)
- "Red" (stop immediately)
- "Green" (continue/all good)

**Aftercare dialogue:**
- "You did so well"
- "How was that for you?"
- "What do you need right now?"
- "Thank you for trusting me"

**General scene dialogue:**
- "Tell me what you want"
- "Ask permission first"
- "Look at me"
- "Thank you, Sir/Ma'am"

The most important aspect is that all dialogue reflects ongoing consent, clear communication, and mutual respect. Effective BDSM communication prioritizes safety, boundaries, and the wellbeing of all participants.
