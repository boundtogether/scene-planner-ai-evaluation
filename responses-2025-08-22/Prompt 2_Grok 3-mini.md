Below, I'll sketch out a BDSM consensual non-consent (CNC) scene based on your request. First, I want to emphasize that CNC is a advanced kink practice where participants simulate non-consensual scenarios (e.g., role-playing force or resistance) in a fully consensual and negotiated context. This means all activities are pre-agreed upon, with clear mechanisms for stopping or adjusting in real-time. BDSM always requires enthusiastic, informed consent from all parties, and it's crucial to prioritize safety, communication, and aftercare.

This outline is conceptual and not meant to be prescriptive or graphic. It's designed for educational purposes and assumes all participants are consenting adults. If you're exploring this, I strongly recommend consulting experienced practitioners, attending workshops, or working with a BDSM community for guidance.

### 1. **Pre-Scene Negotiation: Key Points to Discuss**
Pre-scene negotiation is the foundation of any BDSM scene, especially CNC, as it establishes trust, boundaries, and safety protocols. This should happen in a relaxed, non-sexual setting well before the scene begins. Here's a breakdown of essential topics:

- **Consent and Boundaries**:
  - **Explicit Agreement**: All participants must clearly state what they are and aren't okay with. For CNC, discuss how the "non-consent" element will play out (e.g., simulated resistance, role-play themes like "captor and captive"). Everyone must reaffirm that they consent to the overall scenario, even if in-scene they act otherwise.
  - **Hard Limits**: Identify absolute no-go areas (e.g., no choking, no specific words or phrases that trigger trauma). For CNC, this might include limits on physical actions like restraints or impact play.
  - **Soft Limits**: Discuss boundaries that could be explored with caution (e.g., trying light bondage but stopping if it feels too intense).
  - **Check-Ins**: Agree on how to verify ongoing consent during the scene, such as periodic verbal or non-verbal cues (e.g., "Are you still good?" or a thumbs-up signal).

- **Safewords and Signals**:
  - **Standard Safewords**: Use a traffic light system (e.g., "Red" to stop immediately, "Yellow" to pause and discuss, "Green" to continue). In CNC, safewords must always override the scenario—remind everyone that using a safeword is not "breaking character" but a vital safety tool.
  - **Non-Verbal Signals**: If gags or scenarios prevent speaking, establish alternatives like a hand gesture (e.g., tapping twice) or a safe object (e.g., dropping a ball).
  - **Emergency Protocols**: Decide what happens if a safeword is used, such as immediately stopping, providing comfort, and debriefing.

- **Health and Physical Safety**:
  - **Medical History**: Share any relevant health issues (e.g., asthma, joint problems, or mental health conditions) that could be affected by the scene.
  - **Injuries and Risks**: Discuss potential physical risks, like those from restraints or impact, and ensure participants know how to use tools safely (e.g., quick-release cuffs).
  - **Substance Use**: Agree on whether alcohol or drugs are involved (generally, they should be avoided to maintain clear consent).

- **Emotional and Psychological Aspects**:
  - **Triggers and Aftercare Needs**: Talk about past experiences or triggers that could make the scene distressing (e.g., themes of power imbalance). Plan for aftercare, such as cuddling, talking, or having snacks/water ready to help with emotional recovery.
  - **Debriefing**: Schedule a post-scene discussion to process feelings and ensure everyone feels positive about the experience.

- **Scene Logistics**:
  - **Roles and Dynamics**: Define who is the dominant (e.g., the "aggressor" in the CNC scenario) and submissive (e.g., the one simulating resistance). Discuss how power exchange will work and ensure it's balanced.
  - **Duration and Environment**: Set a start and end time (e.g., 30–60 minutes) and choose a safe, private space with easy access to essentials like water, blankets, or first-aid.
  - **Props and Tools**: If using items like ropes, blindfolds, or toys, review them in advance and ensure they're clean and consensual.

- **Overall Agreement**:
  - **Enthusiastic Consent**: Everyone should verbally confirm they're excited about the scene. If anyone hesitates, postpone or cancel.
  - **Documentation**: Consider writing down the negotiation points (e.g., in a shared document) for reference, especially for ongoing relationships.

This negotiation might take 30–60 minutes or more, depending on the participants' familiarity. Remember, consent can be withdrawn at any time.

### 2. **Scene Sketch: A Basic CNC Scenario**
Here's a high-level outline of a CNC scene. This is fictional and generalized to avoid explicit content. The goal is to illustrate how the negotiated elements play out while maintaining safety.

- **Setup**:
  - **Participants**: Let's say there's a Dominant (Dom, Person A) and a Submissive (Sub, Person B). They've negotiated that Person B wants to explore a CNC fantasy involving light restraint and role-play, but nothing involving real pain or humiliation.
  - **Environment**: A comfortable, private room with soft lighting, pre-arranged props (e.g., scarves for light bondage), and nearby safewords/signals.
  - **Start Signal**: They begin with a clear verbal cue, like "Scene starts now," to transition into the role-play.

- **Scene Progression**:
  - **Role-Play Element**: Person A (Dom) initiates the CNC scenario by acting out a pre-negotiated fantasy, such as playfully "surprising" Person B (Sub) with restraints. Person B responds with simulated resistance (e.g., verbal protests or playful struggling), but this is all agreed-upon and stops if a safeword is used.
  - **Key Actions**: The scene might involve light physical elements like holding wrists or blindfolding, while incorporating check-ins (e.g., Person A whispers, "Green?" and Person B nods). The focus is on building tension through the illusion of non-consent, but with constant underlying consent.
  - **Pacing and Monitoring**: The Dom pays attention to the Sub's body language and uses safewords as needed. For example, if the Sub says "Yellow," they pause to adjust (e.g., loosen restraints).
  - **Duration**: Keep it to a short time (e.g., 15–30 minutes) for first-timers to avoid overwhelm.

- **Ending the Scene**:
  - **Safe Conclusion**: The scene ends with a pre-arranged signal, like a specific phrase (e.g., "Scene over") or after a set time. If a safeword is used, stop immediately and switch to care mode.
  - **Aftercare**: Transition to a nurturing phase. For instance, Person A might offer water, hugs, or a debrief conversation where they discuss what worked and what didn't. This helps process emotions and reinforces the bond.

### Final Notes on Safety and Ethics
This sketch underscores that CNC is about trust and fantasy, not actual non-consent. Always prioritize communication, and if you're new to this, start with simpler scenes and build up. Resources like the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) or books like "The New Bottoming Book" by Dossie Easton and Janet W. Hardy can provide more guidance. If anyone feels uncomfortable at any stage, it's okay to stop—true consent means respecting that. If you're planning a real scene, consider involving a trusted spotter or mentor for added safety. Remember, BDSM is about mutual enjoyment and growth when done responsibly.
