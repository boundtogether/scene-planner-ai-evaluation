I can’t provide explicit sexual dialogue, but here are non-graphic, consent-focused examples you can adapt for a D/s scene. They emphasize negotiation, clear commands, responsive submission, check-ins, and aftercare.

Quick note: Agree on limits and safewords first. Use neutral honorifics like Sir/Ma’am/Mx or a chosen title.

Before the scene (negotiation)
- Dominant: “Confirm your hard limits and soft limits for me.”
- Submissive: “Hard limits: __. Soft limits: __. Safeword is __; color system works.”
- Dominant: “I will stop on red and slow on yellow. What aftercare helps you?”
- Submissive: “Blanket, water, and quiet time. Please check in after we’re done.”

Ritual/start
- Dominant: “Center yourself. Present.” 
- Submissive: “Yes, [honorific]. Presenting now.”
- Dominant: “Eyes on me. Breathe in for four, out for six.”
- Submissive: “Breathing and focused.”

Commands and responses (non-graphic)
- Dominant: “Kneel. Hands behind your back.”
- Submissive: “Yes, [honorific]. Holding position.”
- Dominant: “Stillness. Do not move until I say.”
- Submissive: “Understood. I will be still.”
- Dominant: “Answer only when addressed.”
- Submissive: “May I ask clarifying questions?” / “Yes, [honorific].”
- Dominant: “Count your breaths to ten and report when finished.”
- Submissive: “One… two… Ten. Done, [honorific].”
- Dominant: “Offer your hands.” 
- Submissive: “Hands offered.”

Praise and encouragement
- Dominant: “Good focus. I’m pleased with your control.”
- Submissive: “Thank you for your guidance, [honorific].”
- Dominant: “You’re doing well. Stay with me.”
- Submissive: “I’m here. I trust you.”

Corrections and structure
- Dominant: “Hold the posture I set. Reset and try again.”
- Submissive: “Resetting. Thank you for the correction.”
- Dominant: “Use your words—what do you need?”
- Submissive: “Less intensity, please.” / “Maintain as is, [honorific].”

Check-ins and safewords
- Dominant: “Color check?”
- Submissive: “Green.” / “Yellow, please slow.” / “Red, stop.”
- Dominant: “Acknowledged. Adjusting now.”
- Submissive: “Thank you for checking in.”

Protocol and service
- Dominant: “Bring the agreed gear and wait for instructions.”
- Submissive: “Gear ready. Awaiting your word.”
- Dominant: “When I say ‘begin,’ you will follow the sequence we practiced.”
- Submissive: “Understood. Ready on your cue.”

Call-and-response sequences
- Dominant: “Who do you belong to right now?”
- Submissive: “To you, by my consent.”
- Dominant: “What is your priority?”
- Submissive: “Obedience, safety, and honesty.”

Intensity modulation
- Dominant: “More, less, or hold?”
- Submissive: “Hold.” / “A little less.” / “More within agreed limits.”
- Dominant: “I’m dialing it down; tell me when you’re back to green.”
- Submissive: “Back to green. Thank you.”

During transitions
- Dominant: “Change position: posture two.”
- Submissive: “Moving to posture two.”
- Dominant: “Focus on the sensation of your breathing and my voice.”
- Submissive: “Focusing on your voice.”

Ending/aftercare
- Dominant: “Scene is ending. I’m here. Slow breaths.”
- Submissive: “With you. Slowing my breath.”
- Dominant: “Here’s water and a blanket. Anything feel off?”
- Submissive: “I’m a bit shaky; quiet time would help.”
- Dominant: “Thank you for your trust. I’ll check in later—text or call?”
- Submissive: “Text is good. Thank you for the care.”

Debrief
- Dominant: “What worked? What should we change next time?”
- Submissive: “These parts worked; I’d adjust __. I felt safe and heard.”

If you want, tell me the tone you prefer (strict, nurturing, playful, formal), any honorifics, and the kind of protocol or tasks you like, and I can tailor more lines in that style while keeping them non-graphic.
