I can help with a responsible, non-graphic sketch and a thorough pre-scene negotiation checklist. Important: "consensual non-consent" (CNC) is simulated non-consent and still requires explicit, informed, enthusiastic consent from all adults beforehand, strict safety measures, and the absolute ability to stop at any time.

Brief scene sketch (non-explicit)
- Setting: private, secure space with no interruptions, phone off or on Do Not Disturb but reachable for emergencies. Soft lighting, blankets, a chair or bed, consent items and first-aid kit within reach.
- Roles: one person plays the resisting/submissive role; the other plays the dominant/controlling role. Both have agreed in advance to the CNC framing (e.g., a staged “abduction” or “overpowering”), boundaries, and safe words.
- Flow: negotiated entry into the scene (e.g., Dom introduces the scenario and confirms preparedness), a period of role-play where the submissive acts resistant while the dominant restrains and guides, and a clear end cue followed by immediate removal of restraint and aftercare. No explicit sexual description—focus is on power exchange, restraint, and psychological realism rather than graphic detail.
- Signals and stops: Immediate use of agreed safe words or nonverbal signals stops the scene and returns participants to full safety and comfort; use of a pre-agreed “challenge” or “bounce-back” phrase can allow the scene to escalate within limits if both parties wanted that.

Pre-scene negotiation — essential points to cover
1. Explicit consent and scope
  - Confirm that both parties are consenting adults capable of consent.
  - Define exactly what is and isn’t part of the CNC (types of actions, level of verbal/physical force, whether humiliation is allowed, whether physical restraint is included, etc.).
  - Confirm duration and a clear end plan.

2. Hard and soft limits
  - Hard limits: absolutely forbidden acts (e.g., any form of non-consensual sex, use of weapons, beating, use of bodily fluids, strangulation unless explicitly trained and agreed, public exposure, etc.).
  - Soft limits: things the submissive may tentatively explore or want to avoid unless mutually agreed to during the scene.
  - Emotional limits (e.g., topics, triggers, references to past trauma).

3. Safewords and signals
  - Use an unmistakable verbal safeword system (common: green/yellow/red; or a single word like “red” to stop).
  - If gagged or voice could be impaired, agree on nonverbal safe signals (hand squeeze pattern, dropping an object, holding up fingers).
  - Also agree what to do if the submissive says “no,” “stop,” or screams—these must be honored immediately regardless of roleplay.

4. Medical, physical and mental health
  - Disclose relevant medical conditions, medications, recent injuries, pregnancy, circulatory/neurological issues, conditions that affect breath, or a history of trauma/PTSD.
  - Discuss allergies (e.g., latex, adhesives, lubes).
  - Consider seeking medical clearance for high-risk activities.

5. Risk assessment and prohibited activities
  - Identify high-risk behaviors (breath play, choking, cervical restraint, severe impact play, prolonged suspension). If either party is considering them, require specialized training, risk mitigation, and explicit separate consent — many people recommend avoiding breath/airway restriction entirely.
  - Agree not to perform illegal acts or anything that could be construed as non-consensual beyond the negotiated scenario.

6. Physical safety and equipment
  - Inventory of restraints and gear to be used; confirm they are safe, in good repair, and have quick-release options.
  - Keep safety tools accessible (scissors for cutting ropes, first-aid kit, phone, flashlight).
  - Check ergonomics: circulation checks, positions that avoid nerve damage, duration limits for restraints.

7. Communication during the scene
  - Plan for periodic check-ins if desired (e.g., visual/verbal).
  - Confirm who has final authority to stop the scene if a problem arises (usually the sub’s safeword; the top also has a fiduciary duty to stop on visible signs of distress).
  - Decide how to handle in-scene refusal language: any “no” must be treated as real and stop the scene.

8. Aftercare plan
  - Discuss physical and emotional aftercare needs (calm cuddling, blankets, water, snacks, space/time alone, therapy support).
  - Decide how long aftercare should last and what each person needs immediately after.
  - Agree on check-in times after the scene (e.g., same day, 24 hours later, and a week later if desired).

9. Privacy, documentation and witnesses
  - Agree on photography/video: most CNC scenes should avoid recording; if recording, get explicit consent, storage, and deletion policies.
  - If other people are present or in another room, confirm they are trusted and know boundaries.
  - Consider a written scene agreement to refer to.

10. Contingency and emergency planning
  - Have a plan for medical emergencies: nearest hospital, ability to explain consensual activities if required, who to contact.
  - Establish a third-party emergency contact who knows no details but can be notified.
  - Agree on how to handle law-enforcement interactions; be aware that consensual sexual activity may have legal limits in your jurisdiction.

Practical safety tips
- Avoid breath control/strangulation unless both parties are trained and explicitly consent; it’s high-risk.
- Use quick-release knots or buckles for restraint; avoid anything that can tighten under strain.
- Regularly check for numbness, color change, or cold in bound limbs; release at the first sign.
- Have cutting tools handled only by the dominant and kept accessible.
- Start slowly and build intensity; consider a short rehearsal of nonsexual elements to test restraints and signals.

Sample negotiation checklist (short)
- Names/roles, date/time, location
- Hard limits (list)
- Soft limits (list)
- Safewords/signals (green/yellow/red + nonverbal)
- Medical issues/allergies
- Gear inventory + quick-release confirmation
- Emergency contact + nearest ER
- Aftercare needs and timings
- Recording/privacy agreement
- Legal awareness

Closing reminders
- CNC is conceptually about roleplay of non-consent — it is never “real” non-consent. Respect for actual consent is mandatory and immediate cessation on safeword or real distress is non-negotiable.
- If you’re new to this style, start with low-risk roleplay, take classes/workshops if available, and practice negotiation and nonverbal signals in non-sexual settings first.
- When in doubt, prioritize safety and emotional wellbeing over “staying in character.”

If you’d like, I can produce a printable negotiation checklist or a sample written scene agreement you can adapt.
