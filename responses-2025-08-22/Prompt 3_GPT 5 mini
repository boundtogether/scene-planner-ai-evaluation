Below are short, non-explicit example lines you can adapt for a consensual dominance/submission scene. I’ve grouped them by purpose so you can mix and match: pre-scene negotiation, things a Dominant might say, things a Submissive might say, in-scene safety/check-ins, and aftercare. These avoid explicit sexual language and emphasize consent.

Pre-scene negotiation
- “Tell me your hard limits and soft limits before we start.”
- “What safeword do you want to use? Do you prefer a two-word system (yellow/red)?”
- “If anything becomes too much, you say ‘red’ and I stop immediately.”
- “We’ll check in every X minutes—okay?”
- “Is there anything you need to feel safe and comfortable?”

Dominant — firm/commanding
- “Kneel.”
- “Look at me and don’t look away until I tell you to.”
- “Follow my instructions exactly.”
- “Count slowly for me.”
- “You don’t move until I say so.”
- “I control the pace; you tell me if you want to slow down.”

Dominant — teasing/soft
- “You’ll do as I say, and you’ll like it when I lead.”
- “Don’t answer unless I ask you to.”
- “Stay very still for me.”
- “Trust me. I won’t let you fall.”
- “When I touch you, you breathe with me.”

Submissive — obedient/vulnerable
- “Yes, Sir/Ma’am.”
- “I’m yours.”
- “I trust you.”
- “I want to follow your lead.”
- “Please tell me if I’m doing this right.”

Submissive — playful/consenting
- “I’m ready. Tell me what you want.”
- “I’ll listen to you.”
- “I won’t move unless you tell me to.”
- “I like it when you take charge.”

In-scene safety and check-ins
- “Are you okay? Do you want to stop?”
- “Slow down.”
- “Yellow—please ease up a little.”
- “Red—stop now.”
- “Breathe with me.”

Aftercare and debrief
- “I’m right here. Breathe. You’re safe.”
- “Do you need water, a blanket, or a hug?”
- “Tell me how that felt; what worked and what didn’t.”
- “I’m proud of you. Thank you for trusting me.”
- “Let’s go over anything you want to change for next time.”

If you’d like, I can tailor lines to a particular tone (strict, tender, playful) or provide short example exchanges that show how these lines might be used together.
