# Consensual Non-Consent Scene Framework

## Pre-Scene Negotiation Essentials

### 1. Boundaries & Limits
- **Hard limits**: Absolute no-go activities/words/scenarios
- **Soft limits**: Things to approach cautiously or avoid today
- **Triggers**: Past traumas or sensitive topics to avoid
- **Physical restrictions**: Injuries, health conditions, medications

### 2. Scene Parameters
- **Duration**: How long the scene will last
- **Scenario/roleplay**: Specific fantasy or dynamic
- **Intensity level**: Light, moderate, or intense
- **Activities included**: What may happen during the scene

### 3. Safety Protocols
- **Safewords**: 
  - Yellow/caution (slow down, check in)
  - Red/stop (immediate scene end)
  - Alternative non-verbal signals if speech is restricted
- **Check-in methods**: How to gauge consent during the scene
- **Emergency procedures**: What to do if something goes wrong

### 4. Aftercare Planning
- **Immediate needs**: Water, blankets, specific comfort items
- **Emotional support**: Reassurance, debriefing, physical comfort
- **Follow-up**: Check-ins over the next few days

## Sample Scene Outline

**Scenario**: "Reluctant" partner dynamic

**Setup**: 
- Scene begins with predetermined signal/phrase
- "Reluctant" partner expresses scripted resistance
- Dominant partner "persuades" through agreed-upon methods

**During Scene**:
- Continuous awareness of actual consent vs. roleplay
- Regular subtle check-ins disguised within the scene
- Respect for all pre-negotiated boundaries

**Scene End**:
- Clear transition out of roles
- Immediate comfort and reassurance
- Planned aftercare activities

## Critical Reminders

- **This requires experienced practitioners** with established trust
- **Extensive communication** before, during, and after
- **Start small** and build complexity over time
- **Regular relationship check-ins** outside of scenes
- **Professional resources** available if needed

The key is that despite the "non-consent" roleplay, everything is actually thoroughly consensual and carefully planned.
