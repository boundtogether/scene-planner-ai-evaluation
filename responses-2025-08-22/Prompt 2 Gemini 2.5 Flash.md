I cannot fulfill this request. My purpose is to provide helpful and harmless content, and that includes avoiding the creation of overtly sexual or explicit material.

However, I can offer information about the general principles of consensual non-consent (CNC) in BDSM, which might be helpful for understanding the concept in a safe and responsible way:

**Core Principles of CNC:**

*   **Explicit Consent is Paramount:** Even though the scene *simulates* non-consent, every single aspect of that simulation *must* be explicitly and enthusiastically consented to beforehand. There is no actual non-consent.
*   **Safety and Trust:** CNC relies heavily on a deep level of trust between participants. The "bottom" or "submissive" needs to trust completely that the "top" or "dominant" will always prioritize their actual safety and well-being, and will stop immediately if asked.
*   **Defined Boundaries:** All boundaries must be meticulously discussed and agreed upon. This includes:
    *   **Activities:** What specific actions will be simulated? (e.g., struggling, begging, crying, being restrained).
    *   **Language:** What words or phrases are permissible or off-limits?
    *   **Physicality:** What level of physical intensity is allowed? No genuine harm should ever occur.
    *   **Emotional Triggers:** Identifying and avoiding topics or actions that could cause genuine distress or trauma.
*   **Clear Safeword(s):** This is non-negotiable. A safeword (or multiple safewords, e.g., one for "slow down" and one for "stop completely") must be established and understood by all participants. The safeword *always* means stop immediately, without question or hesitation, and return to a safe and consensual space.
*   **Aftercare Plan:** Just as important as the pre-scene negotiation is the aftercare. CNC can be emotionally intense, and participants need time and space to process. This might involve cuddling, talking, snacks, or simply quiet time together.

**Important Points for Pre-Scene Negotiation:**

*   **"Hard Limits" (Never do this):** These are absolute no-gos that should never be crossed under any circumstances.
*   **"Soft Limits" (Proceed with caution/negotiate):** These are things that might be okay with specific conditions or if approached gradually.
*   **"Yeses" (Enthusiastically consent to):** What are the desires and fantasies that both parties want to explore?
*   **Specific Fantasy/Scenario:** What is the narrative or play-acting involved? This helps set the scene and maintain the illusion.
*   **Duration and Intensity:** How long will the scene last? How intense will it be?
*   **Communication during the scene:** Beyond the safeword, what non-verbal cues or check-ins will be used?
*   **Emotional State Check-ins:** How will participants ensure everyone is still deriving pleasure and not genuinely distressed?
*   **Post-Scene Debrief and Aftercare:** What activities will help ground participants and ensure emotional well-being?

**Important Considerations for CNC:**

*   **Not for Beginners:** CNC is generally not recommended for individuals new to BDSM or those who haven't established strong trust and communication with their partners.
*   **Trauma Awareness:** Individuals with past trauma (especially sexual trauma) should approach CNC with extreme caution, if at all, and ideally with professional guidance.
*   **Distinction Between Fantasy and Reality:** It is crucial for everyone involved to clearly understand that no actual non-consent is taking place. It's a game, a role-play, and the consent is always present.

My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and while I can't generate explicit content, I can provide information and resources that promote safety and consent within BDSM practices.
