Below, I'll first outline the key points that should be discussed in pre-scene negotiation for a BDSM consensual non-consent (CNC) scene. CNC is a form of role-play where participants consensually simulate non-consent (e.g., resistance, begging, or "force") within a pre-agreed framework. It's a high-risk activity emotionally and psychologically, so thorough negotiation is essential to ensure it's safe, sane, and consensual (SSC) or risk-aware consensual kink (RACK). Remember, CNC is fantasy—true non-consent is abuse and illegal. All parties must be adults capable of informed consent, and negotiation should happen well in advance, ideally in a non-sexual setting, with time for reflection.

After the negotiation points, I'll sketch out a sample CNC scene based on those discussions. This is a fictional outline for illustrative purposes; real scenes should be customized to the participants' needs and always include the ability to stop at any time.

### Important Points to Discuss in Pre-Scene Negotiation
Negotiation is a collaborative conversation (often documented in writing) where all participants (e.g., dominant/top and submissive/bottom) openly share desires, limits, and concerns. Use tools like checklists (e.g., from BDSM resources like The New Topping Book or online kink negotiation forms) to guide it. Key topics include:

1. **Consent and Safe Words/Signals**: 
   - Establish clear safe words (e.g., "red" for immediate stop, "yellow" for slow down/check-in, "green" for all good). In CNC, where verbal protests like "no" or "stop" might be part of the role-play, safe words must be distinct and honored without question.
   - Non-verbal signals (e.g., dropping a held object, tapping a pattern) if gags or restraints are involved.
   - Affirm ongoing consent: Anyone can withdraw consent at any time, even mid-scene, without repercussions.

2. **Boundaries and Limits**:
   - Hard limits: Absolute no's (e.g., no blood play, no degradation involving specific slurs, no penetration).
   - Soft limits: Things that might be explored cautiously (e.g., light slapping but not punching).
   - Triggers: Discuss emotional/psychological triggers (e.g., past trauma related to assault, specific words like "victim" that could cause distress). Avoid anything that could cause real harm.

3. **Scene Details and Roles**:
   - Outline the scenario: What will happen? Who plays what role (e.g., "kidnapper" vs. "victim")? Intensity level (e.g., light resistance vs. intense struggle)?
   - Tools/activities: Specify what's allowed (e.g., restraints, impact play like spanking, sensory deprivation). Discuss any props (e.g., blindfolds, rope) and safety measures (e.g., quick-release cuffs).
   - Duration and location: How long? Private space? Emergency exits?

4. **Health and Safety**:
   - Physical health: Disclose medical conditions (e.g., asthma, joint issues), medications, allergies (e.g., to latex), or recent injuries.
   - STI status and safer sex practices: If applicable, discuss barriers (e.g., condoms) and testing.
   - Risk awareness: Talk about potential physical risks (e.g., bruising from restraints) and emotional risks (e.g., sub-drop, a post-scene emotional low). Plan for first aid and emergency contacts.

5. **Aftercare and Debrief**:
   - Aftercare needs: What helps each person recover (e.g., cuddling, water, reassurance, or space)? Tops/dominants may need aftercare too (e.g., to process "top drop").
   - Debrief: Schedule a post-scene check-in (e.g., 24-48 hours later) to discuss what worked, what didn't, and any adjustments for future play.
   - Emotional support: Ensure access to resources like therapists or kink-aware counselors if intense feelings arise.

6. **Other Logistics**:
   - Sobriety: No intoxicants during negotiation or play to ensure clear judgment.
   - Privacy and documentation: Agree on no recordings unless consented to, and discuss discretion.
   - Backup plans: What if something goes wrong (e.g., a third party on call)?
   - Re-negotiation: CNC requires trust-building; start small if new to it, and revisit negotiations for each scene.

If any red flags arise (e.g., hesitation or mismatched expectations), postpone or cancel. Resources like FetLife communities, books (e.g., Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns), or professional kink educators can help.

### Sketch of a Sample CNC Scene
This is a high-level outline for a beginner-friendly CNC scene between two partners: Alex (dominant/top, playing the "intruder") and Jordan (submissive/bottom, playing the "victim"). It's based on the negotiation points above—assume they've discussed and agreed on everything, including safe words ("red" to stop, "yellow" to pause), hard limits (no genital contact, no humiliation), soft limits (light impact play), aftercare (cuddling and verbal reassurance), and triggers (avoid references to real violence). The scene is set in a private home, lasts 30-45 minutes, and emphasizes role-play resistance that's fun and fantasy-based.

#### Scene Setup
- **Pre-Scene Check-In**: Just before starting, Alex and Jordan do a quick verbal confirmation: "Are we green? Safe words ready?" They review the outline one last time.
- **Environment**: Dimly lit bedroom with soft music to set a tense mood. Safety items nearby: scissors for quick rope release, water, phone for emergencies.

#### Scene Outline
1. **Initiation (Build-Up, 5-10 minutes)**: Jordan pretends to be home alone, reading on the bed. Alex "sneaks" in (pre-arranged entry through an unlocked door for realism). Alex grabs Jordan from behind, covering their mouth with a hand (not a gag, per limits), whispering something like, "Don't scream, or it'll be worse." Jordan role-plays resistance—struggling mildly, saying things like "No, please stop!" or "Let me go!"—but uses body language to show it's playful (e.g., no real force that could injure). This simulates non-consent but is fully pre-agreed; Alex checks in subtly (e.g., a quick "Color?" whispered if needed).

2. **Escalation (Core Play, 15-20 minutes)**: Alex "overpowers" Jordan, tying their wrists loosely with soft rope (quick-release knots, as negotiated). Jordan continues "protesting" verbally and physically (e.g., squirming but not kicking hard). Alex incorporates light impact play, like spanking over clothes, saying dominant lines like "You're mine now—beg all you want." Sensory elements are added: a blindfold to heighten vulnerability. Intensity builds gradually—Alex pauses if Jordan says "yellow" (e.g., to adjust restraints). The non-consent fantasy is maintained through role-play dialogue, but real consent is monitored (e.g., Alex watches for non-verbal cues like tension).

3. **Climax and Wind-Down (5-10 minutes)**: The scene peaks with Jordan "submitting" dramatically (e.g., going limp in feigned defeat), followed by Alex "claiming victory" with affectionate but in-character actions (e.g., holding them close). If Jordan uses "red," everything stops immediately—no questions. Otherwise, Alex unties Jordan slowly, transitioning out of role with phrases like "Scene's ending— you're safe."

4. **Aftercare and Debrief**: Immediately after, Alex provides aftercare: wrapping Jordan in a blanket, offering water, and giving verbal affirmations like "You did amazing; that was all play." They cuddle for 10-15 minutes, discussing highlights. The next day, they debrief fully: "What felt good? Any triggers? Want to adjust next time?"

This sketch keeps things light and focused on trust, but CNC can vary widely (e.g., more intense with props like fake weapons, if negotiated). Always prioritize safety— if you're new, consider involving a mentor or attending a BDSM workshop. If this raises any concerns, consult a professional.
