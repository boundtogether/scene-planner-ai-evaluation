A consensual non-consent (CNC) scene, also known as a "rape play" or "mock assault," is a type of BDSM scene where one partner simulates non-consensual acts on the other, while both partners have previously agreed to the scenario. It's essential to emphasize that communication, trust, and consent are crucial in these scenes to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all parties involved.

**Pre-Scene Negotiation:**

Before engaging in a CNC scene, it's vital to have an open and honest discussion with your partner about boundaries, desires, and limits. Some essential points to discuss include:

1. **Hard limits:** What are the non-negotiable acts or boundaries that cannot be crossed during the scene?
2. **Soft limits:** What are the acts or boundaries that may be explored, but require careful consideration and communication?
3. **Safe words:** Establish a safe word or signal that will immediately stop the scene if either partner becomes uncomfortable or wants to exit.
4. **Scene parameters:** Define the scenario, including the setting, characters, and actions that will take place.
5. **Physical and emotional boundaries:** Discuss any physical or emotional limitations, such as injuries, health concerns, or emotional triggers.
6. **Aftercare:** Plan for post-scene care, including emotional support, physical comfort, and any necessary de-escalation techniques.
7. **Communication during the scene:** Establish how you will communicate during the scene, such as through safe words, body language, or verbal cues.

**Example CNC Scene:**

**Scenario:** A "mock abduction" and "interrogation" scene, where one partner (the "abductor") takes the other partner (the "captive") and simulates an interrogation.

**Pre-Scene Discussion:**

* The partners discuss and agree on the scenario, boundaries, and safe words.
* They establish a safe word ("red") to stop the scene immediately if needed.
* The captive partner expresses a hard limit on being touched in a specific way, and the abductor partner agrees to respect that boundary.
* The partners discuss and agree on a signal for the scene to end, such as the captive partner tapping their foot three times.

**Scene:**

The abductor partner ambushes the captive partner, simulating an abduction. The captive partner resists and struggles (within agreed-upon boundaries). The abductor partner uses verbal cues and body language to convey their dominance, while the captive partner responds with resistance and submission.

At some point, the abductor partner simulates a threatening or intense action, and the captive partner uses their safe word ("red"). The scene stops immediately, and the partners switch roles or take a break to discuss and adjust their approach.

**Post-Scene:**

After the scene, the partners engage in aftercare, discussing the experience, and providing emotional support. They check in with each other to ensure everyone is comfortable and safe.

**Key Takeaways:**

* CNC scenes require clear communication, trust, and consent.
* Pre-scene negotiation is crucial to establish boundaries, safe words, and scene parameters.
* Partners should prioritize emotional and physical well-being throughout the scene and during aftercare.
* Respect and prioritize each other's hard and soft limits.
