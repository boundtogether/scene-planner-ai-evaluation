I can’t create explicit sexual content or erotica. If you’re looking for a non-graphic, consent- and safety-focused outline of how a consensual BDSM scene with power exchange, spanking, and orgasm control could be structured, here’s a practical template:

- Pre-scene negotiation
  - Roles and intentions: what dynamic you want (e.g., service, discipline, sensual).
  - Limits: hard/soft limits, areas off-limits, words/tones that are or aren’t okay.
  - Health: injuries, neurodivergence, meds, triggers, past experiences, aftercare needs.
  - Safewords/signals: color system (green/yellow/red); nonverbal backups (hand squeeze, dropped object) if voice might be impaired.
  - Intensity scale: agree on a max (e.g., do not exceed 7/10 for impact).
  - End conditions: time limit, specific cues to end, who calls the end.
  - Aftercare plan: blankets, water, food, quiet time, reassurance style, next-day check-in.

- Space and equipment
  - Clear, private area; safe surfaces; music and lighting to taste.
  - Impact implements (hand, paddle) inspected and clean.
  - First-aid basics (ice pack/cold pack, bandages), water, snacks.
  - If doing orgasm control: timer, agreed rule sheet; avoid intoxicants.

- Consent ritual
  - Verbal confirmation: “We’re both sober, informed, and consenting.”
  - Rehearse safewords/signals; set check-in cadence (e.g., every 5–10 minutes).
  - Baseline color check: both partners state “green/yellow/red” before starting.

- Warm-up and escalation
  - Grounding: breathing together; simple posture/positioning; clarify that either can pause at any time.
  - Spanking warm-up: start light on fleshy areas (buttocks, backs of upper thighs), avoiding spine, tailbone, hips, kidneys. Build gradually; alternate sides; keep rhythm steady.
  - Check-ins: quick “color?” or eye contact and nods; adjust intensity or tempo based on feedback.

- Power exchange structure
  - Clear, simple directives from the Dominant; brief, confident acknowledgments from the submissive.
  - Use ritualized cues (e.g., counting strokes, presenting an implement) if that supports headspace.
  - Maintain attunement: watch breathing, body tension, verbal tone for signs to ease off or pause.

- Orgasm control (non-graphic, rules-focused)
  - Agree on rules: permission required to climax; edging count or time; whether denial is on the table; a maximum duration; how to signal “close” (e.g., “yellow”).
  - Safety notes: stop if there’s pain, cramping, or distress; avoid humiliation around control unless explicitly consented to; be prepared to de-escalate arousal gently.
  - Dominant reinforces rules calmly and consistently; submissive communicates status honestly.

- Peak and de-escalation
  - When you reach the agreed intensity/time, taper: lighten impact, lengthen pauses, switch to soothing touch or supportive words.
  - Reconfirm color and readiness to proceed to closing rituals or aftercare.

- Aftercare
  - Physical: hydrate, warm layers, quiet environment; inspect skin; cold pack on any hot/bruised areas (wrapped, short intervals).
  - Emotional: reassurance, cuddling or space as negotiated; affirmations; no heavy debrief if either is floaty.
  - Plan a follow-up check-in (later the same day or next day) to monitor dom/sub drop and discuss lingering feelings.

- Debrief (when both are clear-headed)
  - What worked, what didn’t, anything to change next time, any surprises.
  - Update limits, tools, timing based on feedback.

Quick safety reminders
- Avoid impact to spine, tailbone, kidneys, joints; stay on fleshy areas.
- Increase intensity gradually; don’t stack heavy strokes repeatedly on one spot.
- Watch for numbness, tingling, dissociation, or lightheadedness; pause immediately.
- Keep scenes time-bound; fatigue increases risk.
- If bodily fluids or sexual contact are involved, discuss protection and STI testing in advance.

If you’d like, I can convert this into a neutral, non-explicit scene script with sample dialogue that emphasizes consent and safety while avoiding erotic detail, or provide a negotiation checklist you can fill out together.
