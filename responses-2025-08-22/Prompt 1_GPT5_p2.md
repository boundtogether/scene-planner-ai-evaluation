Below is a neutral, non-graphic scene script that emphasizes consent, safety, and structure. It avoids erotic detail while giving you sample dialogue and stage directions you can adapt. Both characters are consenting adults.

Characters
- D (Dominant)
- S (Submissive)

Setting
- A private, prepared room. Soft lighting, music optional. Implements and first-aid within reach. Water and blankets ready.

Pre-scene negotiation
[D and S face each other, grounded and calm.]

D: Before we begin, let’s confirm we’re both adults, sober, and consenting.
S: Yes. I’m an adult, sober, and consenting.

D: Intentions for today: light-to-moderate power exchange, spanking on safe, fleshy areas only, plus non-graphic orgasm control with clear rules. Agreed?
S: Agreed.

D: Limits?
S: Hard limits: no strikes to spine, tailbone, kidneys, joints; no slurs; no humiliation today. Soft limit: intensity not above 7 out of 10. No marks visible outside clothing.

D: Health notes?
S: Slight lower-back sensitivity; please avoid the top of the hips. I may get spacey—if so, ask for my color.

D: Safewords?
S: Color system: green means good, yellow means slow or lighten, red means stop. If I can’t speak, I’ll tap twice on your arm or drop the safe object.

D: Check-ins every few minutes. I’ll ask for your color. End conditions: 45 minutes or red, whichever comes first. Aftercare: water, a blanket, quiet cuddles, and a check-in tomorrow. Good?
S: Good.

Consent ritual
D: Final confirmation: Are you ready and consenting to begin under these terms?
S: I am. Green.
D: Green here, too.

Warm-up and grounding
[They take three slow breaths together.]

D: Present yourself at the agreed spot.
S: Yes. [S moves into a comfortable, sustainable position.]

D: I’ll start with light touch and warm-up impacts. You can pause me at any time. Color?
S: Green.

Spanking flow (non-graphic)
[Stage direction: D warms up with gentle, evenly spaced impacts on safe, fleshy areas, increasing gradually. No strikes to spine, tailbone, or kidneys. Rhythm steady; intensity builds slowly.]

D: We’re beginning. Count the impacts to ten out loud. If you need me to slow, say “yellow.”
S: One… two… three…

[After a short set, D pauses, places a steadying hand on a neutral area, and breathes with S.]

D: Color?
S: Green. Intensity around a 4.

D: Understood. We’ll go to a 5, not higher. New set—same rules.
S: Yes.

[Another measured set. D alternates sides, avoids stacking hits on the same spot, and watches S’s breathing and posture.]

D: Color?
S: Yellow. Please slow the tempo.
D: Slowing now. Thank you for telling me.

[Tempo eases; impacts lighten. D checks the skin visually and gives a short break.]

Orgasm control segment (rules-focused, non-graphic)
D: We’re shifting to orgasm control. Rules: you need permission to climax. Tell me when you’re getting close; use “yellow” for close, and I’ll instruct you to hold or stop. Maximum three edging cycles, then I’ll decide whether you may climax or we end without one. Any questions?
S: No questions. I’ll say “yellow” when I’m close and wait for permission.

D: Color before we proceed?
S: Green, and I’m clear on the rules.

[Stage direction: They engage in non-graphic, pre-negotiated stimulation consistent with consent. No explicit details are depicted. The focus remains on communication.]

S: Yellow—close.
D: Hold. Breathe with me. Three breaths. Good. Back off now.

[Short pause.]

D: Color?
S: Green. Ready for the next cycle.

[Repeat 1–2 additional cycles as agreed, always with clear verbal control and the option to stop.]

D: Decision time. You’ll either receive permission on my count, or we’ll end without a climax. Are you stable and informed?
S: Yes.

[If permission is granted, it’s given verbally; if denied, D calmly reinforces the boundary. No explicit description of bodily sensations or climax.]

Peak and de-escalation
D: We’re tapering down. No more impact. Slow breathing with me.
S: Yes.

[Stage direction: Soothing, non-sexual touch (e.g., back of shoulder, hand hold). D lowers voice, reinforces safety. Music softens. Both breathe together.]

D: Color?
S: Green, and I’m ready for aftercare.

Aftercare
[They move to the aftercare area. D offers water and a blanket.]

D: Physical check: any sharp pain, dizziness, or numbness?
S: No sharp pain. Mild soreness only.

D: I’ll apply a wrapped cold pack for a few minutes on the warmest area, then we’ll rest. Do you want closeness or quiet space?
S: Closeness, please.

[Quiet time passes.]

Debrief (once clear-headed)
D: Quick debrief: what worked, what should we adjust?
S: The warm-up pace was great. Next time, keep intensity at 5–6. For orgasm control, I liked two edging cycles, not three.

D: Noted. I appreciated your timely “yellow.” I’ll text tomorrow to check in. Anything else you need tonight?
S: Water refill and a reminder I did well.
D: You did very well. I’m proud of your communication and care.

Safety notes embedded in the script
- Impacts stay on safe, fleshy areas; avoid spine, tailbone, kidneys, joints.
- Intensity builds gradually; frequent color checks.
- Clear safewords and nonverbal backups.
- Time-bounded scene and planned aftercare.
- No intoxicants; immediate stop on red or any concerning symptom.

If you want, I can tailor this to a specific tone (clinical, tender, playful-but-respectful), adjust timing, or convert the rules into printable cue cards.
