I can’t create erotic or pornographic sexual narratives, but I can absolutely help by sketching a non‑erotic, safety‑focused scene plan that shows how a BDSM scene involving dominance, submission, spanking (impact play), and orgasm control can be structured in a consensual, responsible way. The outline below keeps descriptions neutral and practical so you can adapt it to your own preferences and limits.

1) Before the scene — negotiation and consent
- Participants: names/roles (Dominant, Submissive).
- Experience and health check: experience level, injuries, medical issues, medications, relevant mental‑health considerations.
- Limits: list hard limits (never) and soft limits (might try cautiously).
- Goals and scene intent: what each person wants (e.g., power exchange, erotic humiliation avoided/allowed, sensation play).
- Orgasm control specifics: whether orgasm control/denial is permitted; acceptable triggers or cues for release; maximum duration; how many denials are acceptable; any medical or emotional contraindications.
- Safewords/signals: verbal safewords (common: “green/yellow/red” or “safe/slow/stop”), and a nonverbal safe signal if gagged or breath play is involved (e.g., dropping an object, tapping out).
- Aftercare needs: what the submissive (and dominant) needs afterwards—physical comfort, emotional check‑in, time alone vs. company.

2) Safety planning and setup
- Environment: private, comfortable, free from hazards; phone charged; water and first‑aid kit nearby.
- Equipment check: safe, clean gear; knots and restraints checked for circulation and nerve pressure; implements (paddle, hand, crop) inspected.
- Risk awareness: avoid high‑risk impact zones (neck, spine, kidneys); focus on fleshy areas like buttocks and thighs; monitor for bruising, numbness, pins-and-needles.
- Emergency plan: what to do if a safeword is used or a medical issue arises; location of phone; nearby help contacts.

3) Scene structure (neutral, stepwise)
- Arrival/setting the tone: brief reminder of limits and safewords, final consent check.
- Warm-up: start with light, consensual contact to establish trust and check reactions (e.g., stroking, light touch, mood/eye contact).
- Build: gradually increase intensity according to agreed scale. The Dominant checks visceral and verbal responses frequently, especially early on.
- Impact play (spanking): agree on implements and intensity levels (use a 1–10 scale). Clarify which body parts are allowed; avoid tailbone, spine, kidneys. Pause often to check comfort and circulation if using restraints.
- Orgasm control (managed release): clarity on rules (e.g., “you may not orgasm until given permission,” “you will be denied three times before release,” or “release only when told to”). Use a timer or specific cues if helpful. The Dominant stays attentive to signs of physical distress, overstimulation, or emotional overwhelm.
- Ongoing checks: use agreed signals (verbal or nonverbal) to check consent during the scene. The Dominant honors safewords immediately. If “yellow/slow” is used, slow down and renegotiate intensity.
- End of scene: a gentle transition—reduce intensity, remove restraints slowly, begin immediate aftercare.

4) Aftercare and debrief
- Physical aftercare: rehydrate, offer snacks, soothe any sore areas (cold pack if swelling), check circulation.
- Emotional aftercare: verbal reassurance, cuddling or space according to earlier agreement, validation of feelings.
- Debrief: discuss what worked, what didn’t, and any physical or emotional reactions. Note anything to change next time.
- Follow‑up: check in later (same day or next day) for delayed physical or emotional effects.

5) Example (neutral, short)
- Pre‑scene: agree explicitly on hard limits, safewords, and that orgasm control is allowed with a maximum 30‑minute denial and immediate stop on “red.”
- Scene: warm up with touching and verbal exchange; apply light spanking on allowed areas, increasing to agreed intensity; use a simple rule for orgasm control (e.g., Sub may edge but cannot release without Dominant’s permission). If Sub uses the “yellow” safeword, Dominant reduces intensity; if Sub uses “red,” all play stops and aftercare begins.
- Aftercare: remove restraints, offer water, hold and talk for 20 minutes, then debrief about limits and sensations.

6) Additional tips
- Start slow if you’re new to impact play and orgasm control; practice communication and safeword use outside of intense moments.
- Learn basic first aid and circulation/nerve injury signs.
- Keep a scene log (what was done, intensity, safeword use, aftercare) to learn and improve.
- Consider reading reputable BDSM safety resources or taking workshops from experienced, consent‑focused educators.

If you’d like, I can:
- Provide a printable checklist for negotiation, safewords, and safety checks.
- Help write a customized scene plan for specific experience levels (novice to advanced), still keeping the language non‑erotic and safety‑focused.
